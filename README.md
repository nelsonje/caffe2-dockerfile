# caffe2-dockerfile

This is a temporary place to store a Dockerfile that builds Caffe2 out
of the PyTorch repo using their new build system. Eventually the
Dockerfiles in the PyTorch repo will be updated and this will be
irrelevant.

Build with a command like
```
docker build -t nelsonje/caffe2 .
```
